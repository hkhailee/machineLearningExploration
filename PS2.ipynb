        "Total coding time around 5 hours research time an additional 2-3. While I believe I answered the questions asked of me in some way the produced code is incorrect in my opinion. It was on the last night that I realized my inital solution to question 2 was wrong. Initially I had coded just a regular k-split and logistic regression seperatly to find the \"best\" C value. Then I relized the question was asking for them together. Looking for motivation I found the ksplit-logistic regression notebook and just revised that. I find my original solution of just using logistic regression in a for loop iterating over C values increasing by 0.01 a better estimate than the logistic regression with k split. This is mainly due to the fact that when ran on seperate occasions my for loop iteration always produces 1.62 while the k-split with logistic regression always produces a different optimal C value."
